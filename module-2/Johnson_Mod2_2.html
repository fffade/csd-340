    <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      Hello, my name is Omar Johnson. I am a college student that goes to Bellevue University, and I am pursuing a degree in Software Development.
      Computer science and programming is my passion.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="sentence">I currently live in Dublin, Ohio, in a one-bedroom apartment.</span> I work on the side at a nearby Chipotle, serving as a food service manager. This
      job helps me pay my bills while I study for school.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have an older sister and a younger sister. My older sister also lives in Ohio and is in college like me. My younger sister lives with my parents overseas.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not at work and not studying for classes, I am likely working on my own projects. These are usually game development or web development related. For example,
      I am currently developing a mobile game called Tower+, similar to tetris but with physics and powerups.
