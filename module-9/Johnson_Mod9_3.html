  <p>Bee Movie</p>

  <p>
    NARRATOR:
    (Black screen with text; The sound of <span id="buzzing">________</span> bees can be heard)
    According to all known laws
    of aviation,
     :
    there is no way a bee
    should be able to fly.
     :
    Its <span id="wings">_____</span> are too small to get
    its fat little body off the ground.
     :
    The bee, of course, flies anyway
     :
    because bees don't care
    what humans think is impossible.
